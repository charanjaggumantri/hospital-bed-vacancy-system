# hospital-bed-vacancy-system a simple machine learning project
This project is a **Hospital Bed Vacancy Prediction System** that utilizes machine learning to estimate the number of available hospital beds based on historical data. The model is built using **Random Forest Regression**, which is trained on a simulated dataset that includes features such as hospital ID, day of the year, total beds, occupied beds, admissions, and discharges. The dataset is split into training and test sets, and cross-validation is used to enhance model reliability. The system is integrated with **Streamlit**, allowing users to interactively input hospital-related data and receive real-time predictions on bed availability. Performance evaluation is done using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and visualization of actual vs. predicted values. This project serves as a foundational step in applying supervised learning models to real-world healthcare resource management.
